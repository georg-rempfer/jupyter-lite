You can tune how conservative or optimistic this estimate for the event occurrence rate should be by setting the ```confidence level```. If you set the confidence level to ```0.95```, the real event occurrence rate will lie within the interval calculated at least in ```95%``` of these evaluations. That means there still is at most a ```5%``` chance that the real event occurrence rate will be worse than the estimated interval suggests.\n\n__Note__\n1. All probabilities are given as numbers between 0 and 1, where 0 represents \"never\" and 1 represents 100% certainty.\n2. The confidence intervals are conservative, i.e., the coverage of this hypothesis test is ```confidence_level``` or higher. That means if you use this notebook with ```confidence_level = 0.95``` for multiple trials, then you should expect the true event occurrence rate to lie outside the reported confidence interval in 1/20 times on average in the worst-case.",
